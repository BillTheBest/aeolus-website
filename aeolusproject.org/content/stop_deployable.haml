  %h2(id="stop-instance") a. Stopping an Instance

  %p
    Shutting down a running instance is very simple.

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        In the Aeolos web interface, go to
        %b RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
        &rArr;
        <b>INSTANCES</b>.

      %li
        Tick the checkbox next to the instance name in the instance list.
        
      %li
        Click the
        %b Stop
        button:
        
  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %img{ :src => "images/getting_started/aeolus_stop_instance_button.png",
          :title => "Shutting down the instance",
          :alt => "Shutting down the instance" }

  %p
    Within a minute or two the instance status should change to say
    <em>stopped</em>:

  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %img{ :src => "images/getting_started/aeolus_instance_stopped.png",
          :title => "Instance has stopped",
          :alt => "Instance has stopped" }

  %p
    Note though, automatic updates of the Aeolus web interface don't
    always work yet.  You may need to refresh the window manually for the
    %em stopped
    status to appear.

  %h2(id="check-for-leftovers") b. Check for instances left running in EC2

  %p
    When using a development version of Aeolus, always remember to check the
    AWS Management Console for instances left running in EC2.

  %p
    It's rare for this to happen, but better safe than sorry:
