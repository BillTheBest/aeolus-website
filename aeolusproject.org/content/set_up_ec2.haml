.warning
  %b WARNING:
  Amazon and other Cloud providers charge fees for using their products and
  services, including EC2.

  %p
    Setting up EC2 with Aeolus means your Amazon EC2 account will be billed
    with their appropriate usage charges as you follow this guide and/or try
    things out.

  %p
    We
    %b ARE NOT
    responsible for any EC2 or other Cloud fees and charges you may incur.
  
  %p
    As a precaution after finishing every Aeolus testing session, you
    %b must
    manually check all storage and instances in Amazon have been terminated
    and removed as you expect.

  %p
    Development versions of Aeolus have on occasion been known to report
    instances as stopped when they are in fact still running in EC2, thereby
    incurring charges from Amazon.

  %p
    %b BE CAREFUL!

  %h2 2. x.509 Certificates

  .note
    %p
      %b NOTE:
      Some field names used in the Aeolus 0.2.0 release are being changed to
      better match EC2.  These are pointed out as appropriate in the
      following steps. 

  %p
    If you already have an existing EC2 x.509 certificate and private key,
    use those for the EC2 x.509 fields.  The private key is used for the
    %em (Aeolus 0.2.0)
    %b Ec2 x509 private key
    field, and the certificate is used for the
    %em (Aeolus 0.2.0)
    %b Ec2 x509 public key
    field.

  .note
    %p
      Releases newer than 0.2.0 have "<b>Ec2 x509 private key</b>" labelled as
      "<b>Key</b>", and "<b>Ec2 x509 public key</b>" labelled as
      "<b>Certificate</b>".

  %p
    Alternatively, or if you don't have an X.509 Certificate yet, you can
    create a new one:

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        On the AWS
        <a href="https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key"

        page, under
        %b Access Credentials
        click the
        %em X.509 Certificates
        tab.

      %li
        Click <b>Create a new Certificate</b>.
        %br
        %br
        A new window will open giving options to download and save the Private
        Key and X.509 Certificate files.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        Download and save the Private Key file using a name that is clear to
        understand, such as <em>EC2 x509 Private Key.pem</em>.

      %li
        Download and save the Certificate file using a name that is clear to
        understand, such as <em>EC2 x509 Certificate.pem</em>.

      %li
        Back in Aeolus, use the
        %em EC2 x509 Private Key.pem
        file for the      
        %em (Aeolus 0.2.0)
        %b Ec2 x509 private key
        field.

        %br

      %li
        Use the

        %em (Aeolus 0.2.0)
        file for the
