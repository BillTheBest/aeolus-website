    The Aeolus Conductor is the central management piece of the entire Aeolus
    project.  If you are new to Aeolus, you probably want to start with the
    conductor.  Installation for the conductor is easiest through installing the
    RPMs; instructions to do that are [here][install].

    If you are not using an RPM based distribution, be aware that the conductor
    has a very long chain of dependencies.  In particular there are many
    rubygems that are required for proper operation.  The rubygems can be
    installed via gem by checking out the conductor git repository from
    [here][conductor], then running:

    $ cd src ; rake gems

    Building from source is also possible.  More detailed instructions are
    available on the individual project pages, but the general sequence is:

    [install]: conductor-install.html

  %ol
    %li Check out the conductor git repository and run rake gems to install
    gem dependencies.
    %li Check out the oz git repository and build and install oz.
    %li Check out the imagefactory git repository and build and install
    imagefactory.
    %li Check out the imagewarehouse git repository and build and install
    imagewarehouse.
    %li Check out the audrey git repository and build and install audrey.
    %li Build and install conductor.
