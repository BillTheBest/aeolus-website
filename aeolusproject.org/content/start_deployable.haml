%h1 Start a Deployable

.warning
  %b NOTE -
  This guide was initially written for the previous Aeolus release, version
  0.2.0, and still needs updating for version 0.3.0.
  %br
  %b (in progress)
  
  %p
    The template creation process and all Aeolus screenshots are now
    substantially different.

%p
  With the image as an AMI in the Amazon Cloud, you can start instances
  when desired.

%p
  We'll take you through starting an instance of the image using Aeolus's
  web interface, then show you how to connect to that image remotely using
  SSH.

  %h2(id="start-instance") a. Start an instance

  %p
    Before anything else, we need to get an instance up and running:

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        In the Aeolos web interface, go to
        %b RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
        &rArr; <b>INSTANCES</b>.

      %li
        Click the
        %b Create
        button.
        %br
        %br
        The page will change to a list of the templates you have created.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        Click the
        %b Launch
        button underneath the Fedora 14 template entry.
        %br
        %br
        The page changes again, asking for further details.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        For the
        %b Name
        field, choose something obvious such as
        <em>Instance 1</em>.
        
      %li
        For the
        %b Pool
        field, choose
        <em>default_pool</em>.
        
      %li
        For the
        %b Hardware profile
        field, choose
        <em>hwp1</em>.
        
      %li
        The value for the
        %b Frontend realm
        field doesn't matter in this instance.

      %li
        Click the
        %b Launch
        button.
  
  %p
    Aeolus will then launch an instance of the template, using the AMI
    created on the previous page.
  %p
    The main view will list your instances, with the message
    "<em>Instance added.</em>" near the top: 

  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %img{ :src => "images/getting_started/instance_added.png",
          :title => "Instance 1 added",
          :alt => "Instance 1 added" }

  %p
    Within a minute or two, the
    %b STATUS
    field for the instance should change to say
    "<em>running</em>".

  %p
    Note though, automatic updates of the Aeolus web interface don't
    always work yet.  You may need to refresh the window manually for the
    %em running
    status to appear.

  %h2(id="configure-ec2-ssh") b. Configure EC2 for SSH connections

  %p
    By default, Amazon EC2 does not allow any incoming connections to
    instances.

  %p
    We now configure it to allow incoming SSH connections:

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        In the Amazon AWS Management Console, go to
        %b EC2
        &rArr; <b>Security Groups</b>.
        %br
        %br
        This displays the list of EC2 security groups.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        Click on the
        %b default
        security group.
        %br
        %br
        This displays the details for the default security group, in the
        lower part of the window.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        Click on the
        %b Inbound
        tab.

      %li
        For the
        %b Create a new rule
        selector, choose <em>SSH</em>.

      %li
        Click the
        %b Add Rule
        button.

      %li
        Click the
        %b Apply Rule Changes
        button just below it.

  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %img{ :src => "images/getting_started/ec2_ssh_rule_added.png",
          :title => "SSH rule added to EC2 default security group",
          :alt => "SSH rule added to EC2 default security group" }

  %p
    EC2 now allows SSH connections to your instances.

  %h2(id="get-ssh-key") c. Retrieve the Private SSH Key

  %p
    To connect to the new running instance using SSH, you need the private
    key generated for it: 

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        In the Aeolus web interface, click
        %b RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
        &rArr; <b>INSTANCES</b>.

      %li
        Click the name of the new running instance.
        %b Instance 1
        in the above screenshot.  This will open the Details view, showing
        the
        %b Properties
        tab for the instance.

      %li
        Scroll down the properties list to locate the
        %b SSH key
        entry.

      %li
        Click the
        %em Download
        text next to it to bring up a download dialog for the SSH private key
        file:
        %br
        %br
        %img{ :src => "images/getting_started/instance_ssh_private_key_download_link.png",
              :title => "Text link to Instance 1 SSH private key",
              :alt => "Text link to Instance 1 SSH private key" }
        %br
        %br

      %li
        Save the private key with a distinctive name such as
        <em>instance_1_private_key.pem</em>.

      %li
        Tighten the permissions of the saved private file to only allow
        access by yourself, and only read access:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ chmod 400 instance_1_private_key.pem
        %br
        %b IMPORTANT:
        %em
          This is because SSH will refuse to use any private key with
          insecure permissions.    

%br

.section-grouping
  %h2(id="connect") d. Connect to the instance

  %p
    Now we connect to the new running instance using SSH:

  %p
    %ol       
      %li
        Get the public address of the instance from the instance list:
        %br
        %br
        %img{ :src => "images/getting_started/instance_public_address.png",
              :title => "Public address for Instance 1",
              :alt => "Public address for Instance 1" }
        %br
        %br

      %li Launch a terminal session on your desktop.

      %li
        In the terminal session, start ssh, passing it the name of the
        private key file for the instance with the "<em>-i</em>" option, giving
        the root user, and giving the public address of the instance:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ ssh -i <b>instance_1_private_key.pem</b> -l root <b>ec2-50-16-146-190.compute-1.amazonaws.com</b>
        The authenticity of host 'ec2-50-16-146-190.compute-1.amazonaws.com (50.16.146.190)' can't be established.
        RSA key fingerprint is bb:af:ad:fc:69:5a:8e:9b:1a:3c:16:7b:14:c2:94:aa.
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? <b>yes</b>
        Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-50-16-146-190.compute-1.amazonaws.com,50.16.146.190' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
        <b>[root@localhost ~]#</b>

  %p
    You are now logged into the running Fedora 14 instance as the root user.

  .warning
    %p
      %b WARNING:
      This Fedora 14 image is from the equivalent of a DVD install, so has
      %b NOT
      had security updates applied.

    %p
      If you intend on running the instance for
      any length of time, you
      %b must
      apply all relevant security updates using a tool such as <em>yum</em>,
      then rebooting.

    %p
      %b IMPORTANT:
      Changes to the file system persist across reboots, but are lost when it
      is shut down.  This means a
      %em yum update
      (then reboot) will be needed each time the instance is started.
