.section-grouping
  %h2
    Aeolus is software for managing your Cloud Computing deployments

  %p
    It supports several of the leading private and public Cloud solutions,
    as well as supporting virtual machines running on your own private
    equipment.

  %p
    While that's useful, the
    %b KEY
    aspect of Aeolus is that you can have virtual machine images running
    (or ready to run) in several Clouds at any time.

  %p
    This completely cuts your dependence upon any specific Cloud vendor,
    allowing you to weather Cloud outages with far less difficulty, and 
    take advantage of the increasing price competiton among cloud providers.

  %p
    %em Next Cloud outage... no problem.
    You can switch to a different cloud in minutes.
