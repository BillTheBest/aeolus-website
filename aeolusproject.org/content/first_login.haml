  %h2(id="first-login") 1. Web based interface

  %p
    After Aeolus has been initialized, with any SELinux and firewall updates
    done, you are ready to use the web interface.

  %p
    Open the following address in your web browser (any modern one), using the
    name of your Aeolus server instead of "<b>server_name</b>":

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        http://server_name/conductor

  %p
    %b USEFUL INFO:
    Aeolus is really several pieces of software that work together.
    "Conductor" is the web based user interface piece.  

  %p
    If everything is working properly, the initial login screen will appear:

  %p
    %center
      %a{ :href => "images/getting_started/initial_login_screen.png",
          :target => "_blank" }
        %img.thumbnail{ :src => "images/getting_started/thumbnails/initial_login_screen_thumb.png",
              :title => "Initial login screen - click to view at full size in a new window",
              :alt => "Initial login screen - click to view at full size in a new window" }

  %p
    %b NOTE:
    The branding says "Red Hat Cloud Engine" instead of Aeolus.  We still
    need to fix that. :)

  %p
    Login now, using the default administrator details set by
    <b>aeolus-configure</b>:

  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %b Username:
    admin
    %br
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %b Password:
    password

  %p
    We'll change that password in a few moments, after introducing you to
    the major parts of the Aeolus interface.

  %h2(id="welcome") 2. Welcome screen

  %p
    Once you've logged in, the main Aeolus web interface appears:

  %p
    %center
      %a{ :href => "images/getting_started/initial_welcome_screen.png",
          :target => "_blank" }
        %img.thumbnail{ :src => "images/getting_started/thumbnails/initial_welcome_screen_thumb.png",
              :title => "Initial welcome screen - click to view at full size in a new window",
              :alt => "Initial welcome screen - click to view at full size in a new window" }

  %p
    The most important parts of the web interface are:
  
  %p
    %dl
      %dt Primary navigation line
      %dd
        This is the horizontal area under the header, containing
        "<b>RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</b>", "<b>IMAGE FACTORY</b>",
        "<b>ADMINISTRATION</b>", and "<b>DASHBOARD</b>".
        %br
        The first three are operational, changing the overall function
        presented by the interface.  The <b>DASHBOARD</b> item isn't
        yet operational.
        %br
        %br

      %dt Secondary navigation line
      %dd
        This is the second level of text, right underneath the Primary
        navigation line.  In the screenshot above, it has the terms
        "<b>POOLS</b>", "<b>DEPLOYMENTS</b>", and "<b>INSTANCES</b>".
        %br
        The options presented here are tied to the Primary navigation.  When
        you click on a Primary navigation item, the secondary navigation
        options change to show what is available.
        %br
        %br

      %dt Saved searches
      %dd
        On the left hand side, this will contain search patterns you've
        saved for frequent use.  We haven't written the code for this section
        yet, so it's pretty much dead space.  You can ignore it.
        %br
        %br

      %dt Main area
      %dd
        This is the area in the middle of the screen.  In this screenshot it
        contains items such as the "Login successful" message, various
        buttons including "Start", "Stop" and "Delete", along with an empty
        list starting with "DEPLOYMENT NAME".
        %br
        %br

      %dt Details view
      %dd
        Not shown in the above screenshot.  This appears when items are
        selected in the Main area, often presenting additional information
        and options.

.section-grouping
  %h2(id="change-passwd") 3. Change the administrator password

  %p
    In the top right corner of the interface, are the words
    "<b>aeolus user</b>", next to "<b>Log out</b>".  Click on
    "<b>aeolus user</b>".

  %p This is a shortcut to the screen for changing your password:

  %p
    %center
      %a{ :href => "images/getting_started/change_password_screen.png",
          :target => "_blank" }
        %img.thumbnail{ :src => "images/getting_started/thumbnails/change_password_screen_thumb.png",
              :title => "Update user details screen - click to view at full size in a new window",
              :alt => "Update user details screen - click to view at full size in a new window" }

  %p
    Change the password now, using the "<b>Change password</b>" and
    "<b>Confirm password</b>" fields.
    %br
    %br
    If you want, also change the First name, Last name, and E-mail fields.
  
  %p
    Click the "<b>Save</b>" button when you're done.
