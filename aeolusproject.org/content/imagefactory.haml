%h2 Summary
%p
  The Image Factory is an external service that allows the Conductor to build
  images for multiple cloud providers from a single image descriptor. The
  builder exposes its services as a QMF agent and uses XML for the descriptor
  format.  The nuts and bolts of building an image are handled by the Oz
  component.

  The resulting images are transferred to the Image Warehouse that pushes the
  resulting images out to the appropriate cloud provider.

%h2 Status
%p
  The image factory is being actively developed. This is a very early
  version, and it should in no way be considered either stable or
  production-ready. At present it supports Fedora, RHEL, and Windows based
  distributions.

  The git repository for the Image Factory resides here:
